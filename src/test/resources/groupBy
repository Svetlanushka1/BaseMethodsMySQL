GROUP BY clause: GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group entries with identical data
and may be used with aggregation methods to obtain summarised database results.

-- select the item column and the count of order ids from the Orders table
-- group them by the item column

SELECT COUNT(order_id), item
FROM Orders
GROUP BY item;

-- count the number of each country and group the rows by country
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS number
FROM Customers
GROUP BY country;

-- select country, state, and minimum age from Persons table
-- group by country and state

SELECT country, state, MIN(age) AS min_age
FROM Persons
GROUP BY country, state;

HAVING clause in SQL is used to filter records in combination with the GROUP BY clause.
It is different from WHERE, since the WHERE clause cannot filter aggregated records.
-- select customers with the same first name based on their age count
SELECT COUNT(age) AS Count, first_name
FROM Customers
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(age) > 1;

-- select the count of customer ids greater than one and their corresponding country
SELECT COUNT(customer_id), country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT(customer_id) > 1;

-- returns the number of values in the Orders table
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Orders;

-- count of customers who live in the UK
SELECT COUNT(country) AS customers_in_UK
FROM Customers
WHERE country = 'UK';

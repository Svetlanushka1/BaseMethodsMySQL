ORDER BY clause: The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort data in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order depending on specified field(s) (DESC).

-- orders all rows from Customers in ascending order by country
SELECT *
FROM Customers
ORDER BY country;

-- orders all rows from Customers in ascending order by age
SELECT *
FROM Customers
ORDER BY age ASC;

-- sort all rows from Customers, first by first_name and then by age
SELECT *
FROM Customers
ORDER BY first_name, age;

-- select last_name and age of customers who don't live in the UK
-- and sort them by last_name in descending order

SELECT last_name, age
FROM Customers
WHERE NOT country = 'UK'
ORDER BY last_name DESC;

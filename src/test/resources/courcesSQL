Learn to protect your databases. SQL databases are one of the most important components of any organization's information system. They contain valuable data such as customers' personal information, financial data, business plans and other sensitive information. Thus, protecting SQL databases is a critical aspect of information system security.
There are several ways to protect SQL databases:

Authentication and authorization. This is the first step in securing SQL databases. Authentication verifies the identity of users, and authorization determines what actions those users can perform in the database. Using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and restricting access rights will help prevent unauthorized access to data.

Data encryption. Data encryption is an effective way to protect SQL databases. It is the process of converting readable data into a form that is incomprehensible to outsiders. Encryption can be applied at both the database and application levels. This will help prevent information leakage in case of unauthorized access to the database.

Regular backups. Regularly backing up SQL databases is an important aspect of protecting them. In the event of a system failure, attack by intruders, or accidental deletion of data, having a backup copy will allow you to quickly restore the database and minimize the loss of information.

Updates and fixes. Regularly updating your SQL database software and installing the latest patches is an integral part of protecting it. Manufacturers are constantly releasing updates to fix vulnerabilities and improve security. You need to keep an eye on these updates and install them as soon as possible.

Monitoring and audit. Regular monitoring of SQL databases allows you to detect any suspicious activity or anomalies that may indicate possible attacks or security breaches. It is also important to audit your databases to be able to

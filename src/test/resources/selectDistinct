How do we use the DISTINCT statement? What is its use?
The SQL DISTINCT keyword is combined with the SELECT query to remove all duplicate records and return only unique records.
There may be times when a table has several duplicate records.
The DISTINCT clause in SQL is used to eliminate duplicates from a SELECT statementâ€™s result set.

-- select the unique ages from the Customers table
SELECT DISTINCT age
FROM Customers;

-- select rows if the first name and country of a customer is unique
SELECT DISTINCT country, first_name
FROM Customers;
